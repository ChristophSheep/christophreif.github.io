# Attitude

## "Legacy code is an attidute."
It starts with your attitude the first day you start coding,
do you want legacy or you want sustainable code.

## "Keep it simple as possible"
Everyone knows it, but nobody do it. Why?

## The short time minded person perhaps get a single point for the fastest lap, but the long term thinker wins the race.
-- Formula One thinking

## Software development can be very easy when you do it right, but on the others very complicated if you do it wrong.
-- Keep it simple thinking

# OO

## I made up the term 'object-oriented', and I can tell you I didn't have C++ in mind
-- Alan Kay, OOPSLA '97
