# "Legacy code is an attidute."
It starts with your attitude the first day you start coding,
do you want legacy or you want sustainable code.

# "Keep it simple as possible"
Everyone knows it, but nobody do it. Why?

# I made up the term 'object-oriented', and I can tell you I didn't have C++ in mind
-- Alan Kay, OOPSLA '97

# The short time minded person perhaps get a single point for the fastest lap, but the long term thinker wins the race.
