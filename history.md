# History

The history is a teacher. The history of computing should teach us something. The history should teach us something that we does not make the same mistakes and grow up.

The history should help to overcome following: "The stupid make always the same mistakes, the smart makes always new ones."

But there is one thing to overcome: *"What you already know, hinders you what you want you to know"*. Most people believe they already know the truth about a subject, so they does not seek anymore at this place.

## Mistakes in History

### OO

* I made up the term 'object-oriented', and I can tell you I didn't have C++ in mind
  -- Alan Kay, OOPSLA '97

### Lisp

* People do not like Lisp because of the parenthises, because they do not understand why they are there.
