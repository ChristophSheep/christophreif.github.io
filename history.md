# History

The [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History) is one of our teachers[^1]. The history of computers should teach us something. History should teach us something that we don't make the same mistakes and grow up.


## Overcomer

But there some things to overcome: 

> *"What you already know, hinders you from what I want you to know."* 

Most people believe they already know the truth about a subject, so they doesn't seek anymore at this place. Here is another one problem.

> *"The stupid make always the same mistakes, the smart makes always new ones."*

## Why history is important?

### Google for "Why is the study of history important?"

Studying history helps us understand how events in the past made things the way they are today. With lessons from the past, we not only learn about ourselves and how we came to be, but also develop the ability to avoid mistakes and create better paths for our societies.

## Some Mistakes in History

### OO

* I made up the term 'object-oriented', and I can tell you I didn't have C++ in mind
  -- Alan Kay, OOPSLA '97

### Lisp

* People do not like Lisp because of the parenthises, because they do not understand why they are there.

## Stuff

* [AI Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter)
* [Null Pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer)

> In 2009, Sir Tony Hoare stated[14] that he invented the null reference in 1965 as part of the ALGOL W language. In that 2009 reference Hoare describes his invention as a "billion-dollar mistake":

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
