# Simple

Use Power of Abstraction
Use Axioms

JSON is simple and has only String, Numbers and Boolean.

But we have that only because of old hardware.

A String  is a list of characters.
A Number is a list of digits 0..9 and +/- and e.
A Boolean is only NIL (=false) and else that is not NIL (=true).

So Cel of Paul Graham is much mor simple then JSON.
Because Lisp is a List processing language.
And list are the most powerful data structure.

[\a \b \c] = "abc"               (CEL)
[- 1 2 3 4 5 e - 2] = -123.45  (DEC64, MMIX - 64Bit RISC)

123.45   e-2  12345
 12.345  e-3  12345
