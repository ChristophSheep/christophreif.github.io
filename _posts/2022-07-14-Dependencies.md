__Dependencies__ are everywhere. The problem is we often not care about. Babies depend on there parents that they feed them. A state like Germany or Austria depend on russian gas or oil. In software one module depend on the are module. If you not care about dependecy you are in a mess. So you software will get a mess if it gets older and you country get into a mess or in troubles, if you not care about the dependencies. Your dependencies need to be healthy and show into the right directions. As we can see from some example dependencies are often total overseen. We don't want to see it. Or we are so focus and things we can not see the problem and where it is come from. Every problem has a come from. We call that tracing the root of the problem.
