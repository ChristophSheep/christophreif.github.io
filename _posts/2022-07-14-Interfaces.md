__Interfaces__ are nothing new. In software industrie famous poeple invent things, like an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)), that are common sense outside of software development world. Before we had computer we developed other things. And if you work together with many people on a complex big things, so you can not do it alone, so many people have to work together. You need other companies that create parts that fits into the bigger complex thing. So you need to have something like an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)). If you work with parts that are manufactured by many different company you also need an interface. 

## Lightbulb example

For instance a lightbulb has an interface. This interface was invented by [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison) for his lighbulb. We call it E14 or E27. [E27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb) is a shorthand for Edison 27 mm. Today we use LED lightbulb this a different technology, but we have still the same interface to screw the lightbulb into the sockets. Basically this is the same as a plugin. You can plugin or screw in a different lightbulb from a different manufactor of lighbulbs and when the producer implements the interface E14 or E27 you can screw it in.

## Metric screw example

<img class="right" style="padding:0.25em" width="200" src="/assets/images/essays/metric_screw.png"> Another example is a metric screw. There are many manufacturers of this kind of screw. And if the producer implement for instance the M5 interface you can screw it into a M5 hole. 

## USB example

Again another example is [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB). USB is an interface to plugin in devices that you even not know you will have in the future. For instance you can plug out your old external harddisk and plug in a very big and fast 3TB SSD harddisk. You can plugin an joystick or a driving wheel for [Mario Kart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart).
