B[arbara Liskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov) did a TEDx talk about [How Data Abstraction changed Computing forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTc1BTFdIo). She talks how abstract thinking helps to create better software code and overcome the software crisis they had. Because you does not have to implement everything new all the time, instead you go a level higher (that why we have High Level languages) and build on abstract data types and layers.

For instance if you have a dog and a cow and a duck. So what is the abstract things about this. All these are *animals* and all this a level higher are simply *objects*. And objects have attributes like size, color, type, weight and so on. And that is also the reason why [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) was and is so succesfull. You can create an object as a hastable with key-value pairs that are you attributes of an object. [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and all this [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) are the same. You have an object with attributes. 
```
<p style="color:red;">paragraph</p>
```
This is a paragraph object has a style attribute with the value "color:red". Which is again a key-value pair as you can see.

So abstraction[^1] is also not something new, that was invented in the software industry. They just found out, how they can use it, to create better software.

## Examples of abstraction

* I/O devices in Operations Systems
* Everything is a stream of bytes (= file)
* UNIX Pipes - stdin/stdout
* Abstract base classes in OO
