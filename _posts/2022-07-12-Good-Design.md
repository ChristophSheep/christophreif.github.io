_Good design_ has attributes like an object has attributes. An object might have the attributes of color or length or weight. So what attributes are belings to good design?

If believe good design is *flexible and rigid* at the same time. I use the illustration of our human body. I believe our human body is a good design. Because it is rigid and flexible. I believe it is made to survive. There are two things, first there is the skeleton (another word in English for the german word *Skellett* is framework).<center><img class="middle" width="300" src="/assets/images/essays/musculoskeletal.jpg"></center>
And the second things are muscles. Wikipedia says: "Together with the skeletal system in the human, it forms the [musculoskeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system), which is responsible for the movement of the body."
The muscles without the skelet could do nothing. The skelet without the muscle can also do nothing. So the skelet is the rigid part of the body and the muscles are the flexible part of the body system. So both belong to each other.

The musculoskeletal system[^1], wiki says, responsible for the movement of the body. I believe if you use the same idea for software. You create a software that is able to move forward into the future even when you not know the future. But because of the flexibility you are able adapt to new situations. On the other you need a rigid core system that your software system does not fall apart.

Like the skelett, the core should be light weighted. You get it lighweighted by make a small core, that uses the power of abstraction.

Another word for a rigid is stiffness[^2] and the opposite of stiffness is flexibility[^3].
