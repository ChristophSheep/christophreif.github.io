Why you should [keep it simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)? I asked the opposite question. Why you would like to make everything complicated?
Many people does not believe that you need to keep things simple as possible to make a complex thing. The world is complex. A [system is complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system). <center><img class="middle" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/OpenSystemRepresentation.svg/504px-OpenSystemRepresentation.svg.png" width="200"></center> But if you build in a complex complicated stuff then you mess it up. Complicated things are hard to understand for the humane brain. Most poeple does not people that you very complex things can still be simple. They way you organize a complex things is by [layers of abstractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)). Every layers build on top of the above layer. The lowest layer is the most abstract layer and this layer is also the simplest layer. This is like atoms. And atom build out of [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton), [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron) and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron). So this is a [layer of abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)). And protons are build of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark). You this are [layers of abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)). <center><img class="middle" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/2018_Map_of_the_Complexity_Sciences_HD.jpg" width="300"></center>From [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) and rules like [octet rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_rule) you can make [chemicals elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) like air or water or metals. And with this materials you build other stuff.
