You let the poeple build and build and build until it is so big and dangerous that the authorities,
the government, had to demolish the walled city. 

And this are the compensation costs for demolish the city.

> The government distributed some HK$2.7 billion (US$350 million) in compensation to the estimated 33,000 residents and businesses in a plan devised by a special committee of the Hong Kong Housing Authority.

This is also what a software, that is bloated, will cost for a company after demolish it and do a fresh start.

The earlier you realize that the cheaper it is. Be wise.
