__Plugins__ are a very important concept for sustainable software architecture. [Plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(Computing)) allow you to extend your software product without breaking the stable core code. The core should be very abstract and stable and the [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)) use this core as API with an layer between and simple and generic interfaces. Basically, you should write your code so that classes or modules can be plugged in and out of other plugins. The opposite is, if you need a new function, add the code for the function here and there throughout the codebase. Now you've messed up the stable code and need to test everything. That's a bad idea.

## Furniture example

For example, we can buy new furniture in our apartment and it will then be added to our apartment. If we don't like it or need something else years later, we can remove or replace the piece of furniture. Likewise, a plugin can be installed and used and then removed again when we no longer need it. A plugin is like a tool. If I need a hammer to get a job done, I'll get one. When I don't need the hammer, I put it back in the box to keep my workspace clean.

## Oberon OS

This is true modular software where you can load[^2] use and release[^2] a module when you no longer need it. The operating system that emerged from Niklaus Wirth's Oberon[^1] project has this feature. It has a module system called _Modules_ that has a _Load_ and a _Free_ method. In Oberon OS you can develop a module, then compile, load and use it. If you no longer need it, you can release it. Even if Oberon OS looks outdated visually, it is certainly ahead of its time.
