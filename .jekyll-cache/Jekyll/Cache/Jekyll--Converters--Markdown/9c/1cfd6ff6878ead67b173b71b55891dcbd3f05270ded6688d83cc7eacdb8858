<p>Following sentences define the paradigm of so called cells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each cell is independent</li>
  <li>Each cell is simple and stupid</li>
  <li>Each cell does not know that there are other cells</li>
  <li>Each cell has no side effects</li>
  <li>Each cell has its own memory</li>
  <li>Each cell has 0 to N inputs</li>
  <li>Each cell has 0 to 1 outputs (or M outputs)</li>
  <li>Each cell calculates the output from the inputs</li>
  <li>Each cell runs parallel, but concurrent to other cells</li>
  <li>Each cell has 0 to N in connections to other cells</li>
  <li>Each cell has 0 to M output connections to other cells</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a huge amount of cells that are connected together.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>A simple cell adds to inputs (a, b) and produce an output c</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        +-----+
   a --&gt;| ----+ |
        | v + | o--&gt; c
   b --&gt;| ----+ |
        +-------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When data is flowing through channel a and data is flowing through channel b
  then also computed data is flowing out of channel c.</p>
