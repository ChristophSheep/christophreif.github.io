<p>My name is <strong>Christoph Reif</strong> and I am <strong>private researcher</strong> in computing.</p>

<p>The word of a re(<em>search</em>)er include the word <em>“search”</em>.</p>

<p>I am just <em>search</em>ing for peaces that fit together to build a piture about the <strong>truth about computing</strong>.
Like in a jigsaw puzzle. You put the right parts together until you see the full image.</p>

<p>There are parts that are true and parts that are not true. They only seems true to our reasoning.
But when you test it properly, you see that this parts are not really true.</p>

<p>If you remove and all not true parts and set the true parts together you will see a picture.</p>

<p>Truth is hard to find today, because everybody has an opinion today.</p>

<p>We have a sayings: “Opinions are like noses, everyone has one!”</p>
