# LISP

[The root of lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html) is very interesting thing.

All langauge heading to Lisp.

[Lambda function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). List processing and so on.

Lisp has no syntax because you work on [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

Lisp has a [macro system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) no other language has.

Lisp is like atoms to build materials.

Lisp is not an invention, but more of a discovery.
