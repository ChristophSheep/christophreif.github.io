# LISP

* Lisp can be written in itself[^1].
* Lisp is a programmable programming language[^2].
* Lisp wasn't designed to fix the mistakes in [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran); it came about more as the byproduct of an attempt to [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)atize computation[^4].
* Lisp is not an invention, but more of a discovery[^1].
* Lisp is unique and different[^4], because all languages heading towards to Lisp[^1].
* Lisp can be a secreat weapon[^3].
* Lisp has a [macro system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) no other language has[^4].
* Lisp is like atoms to build chemical materials. Bottom-Up Design[^2].
* Lisp has no syntax, because you work on [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). That's why there are so many round brackets.

## About Lisp

### Pitfalls of imperative programming (SICP - Page 317)

In contrast to functional programming, programming that makes extensive use of assignment is known as imperative programming. In addition to raising complications about computational models, programs written in imperative style are susceptible to bugs that **cannot** occur in functional programs.
