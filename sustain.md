# Sustainable Code

Sustainable code is software that is made with long term thinking of business.

What are the attributes of Sustainable code:

* Flexible
* Robust
* Changeable
* Clear
* Readable
* Understandable
* Maintainable
* Independent
* ...

## Flexible

How to get you source code flexible. Flexible means that you can change you
code if the enviroment change so you are flexible to the world outside around you.

Some create flexible code by making plugins. Plugins are often build around a
small abstract core. For plugins you need an future safe abstract interface.

Because you does not know what the future will bring.

So interfaces or the concept of an interface create a big role.
Interfaces are something like template.

  (deftem obj id 0 name "not set")
  (inst obj 'id 1 name "foo")

## Robust

A sustainable needs not to be flexible, but also robust. If you only flexible
alone that you can not stand against a storm. A robust things does not break
in a storm. 

I always use the picture of our humane body. We have bones for robustness and
muscle for flexibility. Both things work hand in hand. Without bones the
muscle have nothing to attach. The bones alone without muscle can not move
or rotate. And the flesh and the skin glue everything together.

## Changable

Because you does not know what the future brings. You need to be able to change
the software.
