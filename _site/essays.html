    <!-- <p>Our human <strong>brain</strong> is a wonderful thing when understood and used properly. Some say the computer is modeled after the human brain, but if you read how the brain works in general, you’ll see that it’s different. What do I mean in simple terms why is it different? Our brain can process an extremely large amount of data in real time and stores an extremely large amount of data over the course of a lifetime. Some believe that all computers combined are not as good as a single human brain. So why is it different. Computers usually process information very quickly, but one at a time. Currently (2022) a standard computer CPU has only 8 cores. So you can really run a maximum of 8 things in parallel. But our human brain works fully parallel and simultaneously. Each individual cell is a small CPU. And it’s a network of cells through which data flows, producing an output from the input. To me it’s basically an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O device</a> and each little neuron cell is an I/O device. Brain researchers say the brain isn’t very fast (100MB/s)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, so why can it process so much data? The brain works extremely parallel and slow compared to a CPU which works extremely fast and serial. Which is better - do one thing at a time with a very fast CPU or process a huge amount of data in parallel with billions of small cells (CPUs)?</p>

    <!-- <p><strong>Plugins</strong> are a very important concept for sustainable software architecture. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(Computing)">Plugins</a> allow you to extend your software product without breaking the stable core code. The core should be very abstract and stable and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)">plugins</a> use this core as API with an layer between and simple and generic interfaces. Basically, you should write your code so that classes or modules can be plugged in and out of other plugins. The opposite is, if you need a new function, add the code for the function here and there throughout the codebase. Now you’ve messed up the stable code and need to test everything. That’s a bad idea.</p>

    <!-- <p><strong>Interfaces</strong> are nothing new. In software industrie famous poeple invent things, like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interface</a>, that are common sense outside of software development world. Before we had computer we developed other things. And if you work together with many people on a complex big things, so you can not do it alone, so many people have to work together. You need other companies that create parts that fits into the bigger complex thing. So you need to have something like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interface</a>. If you work with parts that are manufactured by many different company you also need an interface.</p>

    <!-- <p><strong>Dependencies</strong> are everywhere. The problem is we often not care about. Babies depend on there parents that they feed them. A state like Germany or Austria depend on russian gas or oil. In software one module depend on the are module. If you not care about dependecy you are in a mess. So you software will get a mess if it gets older and you country get into a mess or in troubles, if you not care about the dependencies. Your dependencies need to be healthy and show into the right directions. As we can see from some example dependencies are often total overseen. We don’t want to see it. Or we are so focus and things we can not see the problem and where it is come from. Every problem has a come from. We call that tracing the root of the problem.</p>

    <!-- <p>B<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov">arbara Liskov</a> did a TEDx talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTc1BTFdIo">How Data Abstraction changed Computing forever</a>. She talks how abstract thinking helps to create better software code and overcome the software crisis they had. Because you does not have to implement everything new all the time, instead you go a level higher (that why we have High Level languages) and build on abstract data types and layers.</p>

    <!-- <p>Why you should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep it simple</a>? I asked the opposite question. Why do you want to complicate everything? Why does everyone know this phrase, keep it simple, but it seems that nobody is doing it? And why don’t they think it’s something really important? What you do shows what you believe in.</p>
