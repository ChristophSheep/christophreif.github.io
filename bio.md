My name is Christoph Reif and I am private researcher in computing.

The word of a re(search)er include the word "search".

I am just *search* for peaces that fit in a jigsaw puzzle about the *truth about computing*.

I am looking for the good parts and try to understand which are the bad parts
to remove this parts out of my brain. Or at least try to understand, what we
thinks is not true.

I'm consistantly searching for the truth of computing and collect of parts that are true.
Truth is hard to find today, because everybody has an opinion today.

We have a sayings: "Opinions are like noses, everyone has one!"

Because our brain is a rule extraction machine if there are rules it will
find it automatically by putting enough information into my neuronal network
between my ears.
