# Bio

My name is __Christoph Reif__ and I am __private researcher__ in computing.

The word of a re(*search*)er include the word *"search"*.

I am just *search*ing for peaces that fit together to build a picture about the __truth about computing__.
Like in a jigsaw puzzle. You put the right parts together until you see the full image.

There are parts that are true and parts that are not true. They only seems true to our reasoning. But when you test it properly, you see that this parts are not really true. If you remove and all not true parts and set the true parts together you will see a picture. **Truth is hard to find** today, because everybody has an opinion today. We have a sayings: "Opinions are like noses, everyone has one!"

## Difference between true and truth

There is a big difference between having true things and have truth about a subject.
