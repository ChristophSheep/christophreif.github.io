# Bio

My name is __Christoph Reif__ and I am __private researcher__ in computing.

The word of a re(*search*)er include the word *"search"*.

I am just *search*ing for peaces that fit together to build a picture about the __truth about computing__. Like in a jigsaw puzzle. You put the right parts together until you see the full image.

## True and Truth

There are parts that are true and parts that are not true. They only seems true to our reasoning. But when you test it properly, you see that this parts are not really true. If you remove and all not true parts and set the true parts together you will see a picture. **Truth is hard to find** today, because everybody has an opinion today. We have a sayings: "Opinions are like noses, everyone has one!"

## The future is in the past

When you go back in history you can find the point where the whole IT industrie has turned the wrong.
Like in a [roundabout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout), you can enter the roundabout, but you have to decide where to exit the roundabout. Is it going to north? Is it going to south? Is it goind to west or east? Or any other direction.
If you choose the wrong direction and you believe you are on the right path then you drive fast. But after 50 years of IT technology you see the fruits. Are the fruits good?
Fruits are sign like on the road. That show if you are at the right road.

If you drive to south and the sun is not on the right place and you still believe you are drving to south then you should start to think. Are you sure you drive the right directions?

## Signs your are right or wrong

Signs like bloat ware or Parkinson perhaps not the right signs you want.

Niklas Wirth wrote 1995 in his aritcle ["A Plea for Lean Software"](https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf)
about the signs.

John Backus wrote in his article ["Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style? A functional style and its algebra of programs"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/359576.359579)
about the signs.

Many does not believe in signs. There are still going to north, but the signs say STOP please turn you are going the wrong directions.

Some people have <img width="100" style="float: left; display: inline;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/ab/b9/19abb9656d66962467c801e0e85bb27c.jpg"> in there eyes. That makes them blind for the signs.

Another problem is the concept of Blind lead the blind. Blind leader that have dollar signs can not see the truth about. And perhaps both fall into hole.

## Basic idea

Because we all have a neuronal network between our ears that is a rule extraction machine, if you feed the brain with true parts, it could find the truth, without thinking to much or reasoning to much. Reasoning it often the place where you believe things that are not true and still not recognize it. For instance the people believe that the earth is a plan and not a sphere. You could be killed in these days if you said the opposite.

## Future of Computing

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Computer get more cores every years.

Parallel and Concurrent Computing.

Functional programming.

Data Flow Processor Architecture.
