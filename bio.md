Christoph Reif is private researcher in computing and writer.

Inside the word of a researcher there is the word "search".

I am just search for peaces that fit in a jigsaw puzzle about computing.

I am searching for the good parts and try to understand which are the bad parts
to remove this parts out of my brain. Or at least try to understand, what we
thinks is not true.

I search for the truth of computing and collect of parts that are true.

Because our brain is a rule extraction machine if there are rules it will
find it automatically by putting enough information into my neuronal network
between my ears.
